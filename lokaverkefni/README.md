<h1>FORR3JS05DU  Ólafur Ásdíssonar</h1>
This is my lokaverkefni. It is a simple webpage in javascript that calls an API to get info about conserts in Iceland.

The url for the site is http://tsuts.tskoli.is/2t/0802992579/Javascript/
I couldn't find out to how to get the Project Pages to work. At one point the Git shell overwrote my code.
So I put the page on tsuts

The page mainly works but I couldn't figure out to how make the text hidden when using the search box

Also, I didn't have time to make a video with https://screencast-o-matic.com/  I might try to finish that tomorrow or Tuesday.
