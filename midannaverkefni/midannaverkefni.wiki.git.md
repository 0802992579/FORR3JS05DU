== Breakout ==

A game by Olafur Asdisarson

=== How to play ===

This is the classical game of Breakout. You control a paddle and bounce a ball to knock out the bricks above. You control the paddle by mouse/mousepad by moving left or right or by the left and right arrow keys. As you clear the board you move up levels. So far there are only two levels available

=== Creation of this game ===

This game is based on a tutorial https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript. I have changed the game. I enlarged the screen, added different colours to the bricks. I changed the code so it is now Object based. This change makes it easier to add levels and new features. I added a second level where there are two balls.

=== Further devolpement  === 

Further levels may be added with special bricks making the balls going faster og slower, diffent sized paddles, more than one paddle and differnet layouts
